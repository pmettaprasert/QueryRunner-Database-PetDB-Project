# JDBC Application for Database Management (PetDB)

## Overview

This JDBC Application project is designed to interface with a SQL database, a pet record database, providing a console-based utility for executing and managing SQL queries. The application is an enhancement of the provided QUERYRUNNER, with additional features aimed at improving user experience and extending functionality.
